## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
# read in data
red_wine <- read.csv("data/winequality_red.csv")
white_wine <- read.csv("data/winequality_white.csv")

# add columns for color so we can
# differentiate once concatenated
white_wine$color <- as.factor("White")
red_wine$color <- as.factor("Red")

# concatenate data frames
all_wine <- rbind(red_wine, white_wine) %>% 
  clean_names() %>% # replaces periods with underscores in column names
  rename(ph = p_h) # get rid of underscore in pH column name

# display
all_wine%>%
  head()
```

First, let's check if our data has any missing values.

`is.na()` returns an object that is the same size as `all_wine` but with the values of `TRUE` where values are `NA` and `FALSE` where values are not `NA`.

```{r}
data.frame(is.na(all_wine))%>%
  head()
```

We can now use the `sum()` function to sum all of the boolean values outputted by `is.na()`. This will tell us how many `TRUE` values there are; i.e., this will tell us how many missing values are in our data.

```{r}
data.frame(is.na(all_wine))%>%
  sum()
```

We are lucky; this f


```{r}
set.seed(42069) # for reproducibiility

# get training and testing data
wine_split <- initial_split(all_wine,prop=0.8,
                               strata=quality)

wine_train <- training(wine_split)
wine_test <- testing(wine_split)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
